* sync costs used in path finding and quality
	use functors storing pars, agent
	adapt to vary dependent on agent situation

* topology of known graphs looks weird (lots of unrooted end bits)
	check if that's from received info or if there's an indexing issue somewhere

* implement general consistency check (links - nodes)

* discovered by-foot links should have different defaults than generic links

* agents using direct "by-foot" paths arrive earlier and might therefore swamp info-space


* profile

* check type stability


* let agents exchange info about unconnected links?

* info exchange by interestingness/relevance?

* time!?

* resources/capital (?)

* control?
